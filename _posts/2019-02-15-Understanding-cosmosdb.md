[Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) is a globally distributed, multi model database hosted by azure designed to provide hight availability.

One interesting feature of Cosmos DB is that it provides a (easy integration)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed] to the database event log, with is named the change feed in Cosmos.
